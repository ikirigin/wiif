WIIF: Why Is Ivan Fat?

Historical tracking has shown that slow carb or low carb makes Ivan lose weight. So why is he fat? Because he doesn't stick to the diet.

The purpose of this app is to prompt Ivan to enter in recent meals. Email reminders go out for each meal. A meal is either good or bad. This matches some good tracking done on paper recently.

If there is a bad meal, Ivan's wife (get it? wiif!) Abby is notified by email.
